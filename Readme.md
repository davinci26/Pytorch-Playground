# CNN & Pytorch Playground #

## Project Description ##

The main goal of the project is to reinvent the wheel and learn Pytorch and sharpen my deep learning skills. In this project we will be working on the [Cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

The goals of the project will be defined in the plan forward section.

## Plan Forward ##

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Modularize the PyTorch example project into components.
2. Train the model and become familiar with PyTorch syntax
3. Optimize the hyper-parameters of the model with a `Gaussian-Proccess`

### 2. Azure Forward

1. The goal here is to expand the infrastructure and move it to Azure.
2. Dream bigger :) 

## Disclaimer ##

This is a weekend project. I would advise against using this codebase in any commercial software.
